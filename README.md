</details>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js with npm (only required to build the frontend)
- PHP 7.4+

> Kirby is not a free software. You can try it for free on your local machine but in order to run Kirby on a public server you must purchase a [valid license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

## Setup

### Composer

Kirby-related dependencies are managed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and located in the `vendor` directory. To install them, run:

```bash
composer install
```

### Node Dependencies

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

### Environment Variables

Duplicate the [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env`::

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Optionally, adapt it's values.

### Static Assets

_During development_ Kirby can't access static files located in the `src` folder. Therefore it's necessary to create a symbolic link inside of the public folder:

```bash
ln -s $PWD/src/assets ./public/assets
```

## Usage

### Build Mode

During development a `.lock` file will be generated inside the `src` directory to let the backend now it runs in development mode. This file is deleted when running the build command.

> ℹ️ Alternatively, you can set a `KIRBY_MODE` env variable containing either `development` or `production` to set the app mode programmatically and overwrite the `.lock` file mechanism. This may ease setups with Docker.

### Development

You can start the development process with:

```bash
# Runs `npm run kirby` in parallel to `vite`
npm run dev
```

Afterwards, visit the app in your browser: [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

> For Valet users: Of course you can use a virtual host alternatively!

Vite is used in combination with [backend integration](https://vitejs.dev/guide/backend-integration.html) and only serves frontend assets, not the whole app. Thus, `http://localhost:3000` won't be accessible.

The backend is served by the PHP built-in web server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default, but you can adapt the location in your `.env` file.

### Production

Build optimized frontend assets to `public/dist`:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will generate a hashed version of all assets, including images and fonts saved inside `src/assets`. It will further create a `manifest.json` file with hash records etc.

### Deployment

> ℹ️ See [ploi-deploy.sh](./scripts/ploi-deploy.sh) for exemplary deployment instructions.

> ℹ️ Some hosting environments require to uncomment `RewriteBase /` in [`.htaccess`](public/.htaccess) to make site links work.
